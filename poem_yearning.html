        <h1>Yearning</h1>
        <p>
            Sifting through the soft wisps<br>
            Of cotton, emerges the shining disc.<br>
            And then quick as a wink<br>
            Vanishes as if playing hide and seek.<br><br>

            The dark sheet stretching<br>
            Far away into the infinite<br>
            Is still aglow; though<br>
            Much diminished is the light.<br><br>

            In the time it’s away<br>
            Bright spots here and there,<br>
            Each a flickering flame,<br>
            Suffice till it appears again.<br><br>

            In its absence is one more<br>
            Sight to behold; one subdued roar<br>
            To be heard as a colourful spark<br>
            Momentarily lights up the dark.<br><br>

            It all seems a mesmerizing pattern<br>
            On a velvet black canvas.<br>
            Lost in the depths of the scene<br>
            Enter I into a dream, a trance.<br><br>

            I stretch out a hand, longing<br>
            To hold the gems this time.<br>
            Futile I realize; all efforts in vain.<br>
            Perhaps now they aren’t yet mine.
