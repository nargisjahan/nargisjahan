        <h1>The Nightmare Called Boards</h1>
        <p>
            Under tremendous stress and strain<br>
            Wailed every inch of my brain<br>
            To seek some succour some relief<br>
            From the maddening days of grief<br><br>

            In trying to swallow the impossible pile<br>
            Of material on the desk while<br>
            The scared heart let out a pitiful moan<br>
            And a wretched me began to groan<br>
            And pray for deliverance from this pain.<br>
            I tried to focus and be a little sane<br><br>

            Whenever I felt like I would swoon<br>
            I would say ‘this too shall pass’ and soon.<br>
            Well now it has passed, I’m a free soul<br><br>

            Relieved to discover I’m hale and whole<br>
            After all the dents and bruises and cuts<br>
            The boiling tension that drove me nuts<br>
            Brought me often to the verge of tears<br>
            As I struggled against my deepest fears<br><br>

            Now after weeks of daunting despair<br>
            I gladly throw away every ‘petty’ care<br>
            Put behind all those memories vile<br>
            Summon my lost long ago smile<br><br>

            And nose dive into the world of fun<br>
            For the evil boards are finally done!
