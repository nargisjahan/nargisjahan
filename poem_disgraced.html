        <h1>Disgraced</h1>
        <p>
            Life shall never be the same again<br>
            Cleansed of joy it is now full of pain<br>
            No efforts can wipe away the stain<br>
            And the bruise won’t let me be sane.<br><br>

            Miss the infectious smile I would adorn<br>
            Caring not a bit for any criticizing scorn<br>
            Enthusiasm that would fill me every morn<br>
            But this while I feel dejected, weak and torn.<br><br>

            Life doesn’t seem beautiful any more<br>
            Going through every mundane daily chore<br>
            It appears destiny has closed each door<br>
            Leaving me in a wretched self pitying stupor.<br><br>

            Forever shall the cruel Disgrace stay<br>
            Ruining every single hour of my day<br>
            Dropping thorns to obstruct my way<br>
            For which sin am I being made to pay?<br><br>

            Carnage looks back from every sight<br>
            Darkness deep in open sunlight<br>
            The memory threatens in dreams at night<br>
            As I recoil and scream with increasing fright.<br><br>

            The course of tears I slowly trace<br>
            A broken soul, I badly need solace<br>
            I plead to give me back my grace<br>
            To put the smile back in its old place.
