        <h1>A Letter</h1>
        <p>
            Life is strangely beautiful<br>
            It makes you feel miserable<br>
            Only so<br>
            You can find<br>
            What it means to be happy<br><br>

            It makes you feel like a loser<br>
            Like a liar and a cheat<br>
            Like a failure<br>
            Going from defeat to defeat<br>
            Only so<br>
            You can realise<br>
            That facing your worst fears head on<br>
            Is the only way<br>
            To bring out the best in you<br><br>

            Life gives you love<br>
            And lets you bask in its glow<br>
            And lets you get all comfortable<br>
            And one morning<br>
            After one fine night<br>
            You wake up to find the sun did not rise<br>
            Your night continues<br>
            You turn in your bed<br>
            To speak of this wonder<br>
            To your companion<br>
            And then you understand<br>
            It was they<br>
            Who went away and took all your sunlight<br>
            Without a warning<br>
            And without a reason<br>
            Love went away<br>
            As suddenly as it had come<br><br>

            You lie in bed in disbelief<br>
            You keep lying on your messy bed<br>
            With your messy hair and troubled head<br>
            You want coffee<br>
            But find it impossible to get up<br>
            You keep lying like that<br>
            For what seems like a lifetime<br>
            In which you grow<br>
            Old and cold<br>
            And sad and scared<br>
            You feel anxious and on edge<br>
            Any small attempt at physical movement<br>
            At trying to help your sobbing heart<br>
            And clogged mind and frozen soul<br>
            Is utterly and completely useless<br><br>

            You have to feel like this some more<br>
            To understand yourself a little better<br>
            You need to embrace your misery<br>
            And maybe put it into a letter<br>
            For you to read<br>
            When you feel this way again<br>
            Because of an altogether different or similar pain<br>
            For you to go back to your roots<br>
            And hold your people close<br>
            To think about what you lost this time<br>
            And how it makes your inner lioness come alive<br>
            With a ferocity that drives away all that is unimportant<br>
            And nurtures all that is authentically you<br>
            That tells you that you are amazing<br>
            With all your virtues and all your flaws<br>
            So go<br>
            Be by yourself in a small crowded park<br>
            With a pen and notepad<br>
            And write away!
        </p>
