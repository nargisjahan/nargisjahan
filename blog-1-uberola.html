    <h1>What is wrong with Uber and Ola in 2022?</h1>
    <p><strong>Published on:</strong> 26 Sep 2022</p>

    <!-- Full Blog Content -->
    <p>The year is 2009. It’s a snowy evening in Paris and two gentlemen, one of them a dropout from UCLA, so classic, are stuck without a cab in sight. And they begin to wonder—what if you could get a cab by a simple tap on your phone? A star in the world of urban mobility—Uber is born. Two years later, in the capital city of India, <em>insert the hola hola music</em>—yes, Ola … was born albeit as a tours and travel company. These two startups have grown by leaps and bounds in the years since to become household names in the metros and Tier-2 cities across India.</p>
        
        <p>In the years leading up to the Great Pandemic of 2020, these two startups were engaged in a bitter rivalry to command the majority of the available market share. It is reported in this article from the early days of the pandemic, when it was widely assumed that corona is just a local Chinese problem, that Uber claimed to have a firm hold on 50% of the available market share. It was projected that the two behemoths were right on track for long-term fast-paced growth. But the sudden brake applied on the economy jolted their progress too.</p>
        
        <p>The work-from-home model, which was perceived as a boon for the overloaded and stressed private sector employees, became a nightmare of sorts for the ride-hailing economy. Only a tiny fraction of employees going to the office, massive reduction in the number of cabs being booked to and from the airport severely affected the livelihood of the cab drivers who were forced to return to their native places.</p>
        
        <p>Towards the first anniversary of the global pandemic, the market started picking up, and this time around, the numbers seemed to place Ola as the better performer. The drop in MAUs (Monthly Active Users) was much greater for Uber than Ola during the second wave. This was also the time when these companies started looking at ways to build customer trust in the face of the deadly virus.</p>

        <p>They also forayed into food and grocery delivery, which was not just an additional revenue stream but a way to help the community in general, thus building more trust.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, the woes were not really over for these giants. And neither for the cab drivers. Many layoffs followed in a bid to sustain the tiny growth or rather, reduction in losses, being seen in FY 2021.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to April of 2022 when the market picked up all of a sudden due to increased demand. Offices started opening and functioning with the majority of their staff commuting daily. Not just ride-hailing, every sector was affected. However, this sudden spurt in demand, which was a much-needed breather for Ola, Uber and their drivers, proved to be a hostile force driving up inflation in the metros, especially in Bangalore.</p>

        <p><strong>Everything became more expensive.</strong> Commuting was mandatory but it was no longer the same as before. As per this article published in <em>The Indian Express</em> in May this year, only 30,000 cabs are plying on the roads compared to about 100,000 during pre-covid times. Now, it is extremely difficult to get a ride, especially during peak hours or on rainy days. Even if you manage to get a booking, either the driver would cancel the ride or the fare would be sky high.</p>

        <p>And the reason for this is the increased cost of living in the metros. When white-collar employees are struggling to manage their expenses in the post-covid era, it is anybody’s guess what kind of financial troubles must be brewing for the drivers from Ola and Uber. As mentioned earlier, about half of them have not returned to the cities yet, preferring to stay in their native places and trying out the local livelihood opportunities such as farming or small businesses.</p>

        <p>At every coffee break, at lunch and dinner time, the problem of finding an economical ride in a reasonable time frame is being discussed. It is the #1 topic trending in the office spaces across the big cities. Pre-covid, these ride-hailing services were growing at an impressive rate and were the first choice for commuting even for people who owned their own vehicles. There was the option of sharing as well, which meant lesser cost per passenger but greater profit for both the company and the driver.</p>

        <p>The covid scare has lessened now and people in general are taking more rides via these apps but they are not happy. Something seems to have shifted fundamentally. The recent floods in Bangalore exposed the chinks in the armour of the city’s civic infrastructure and it is expected that sooner or later, this growing problem with ride-hailing will be taken up in a serious manner either by the authorities or by the customers themselves.</p>

        <p>If we look at the matter one-dimensionally, we might be tempted to think that greater ride value means more contribution to the GDP but growth cannot be and never should be, one-dimensional. It is vital to note that despite higher prices, the ease of booking and taking a ride has taken a major hit.</p>
        
        <p>How this kind of money is to be utilised is decided by various factors but at this moment in urban mobility history, it is imperative that Ola and Uber focus more on enhanced customer experience rather than aggressive growth.</p>
