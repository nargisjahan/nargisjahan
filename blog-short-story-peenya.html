    <h1>The Woman in Black</h1>
   <!-- <p><strong>Published on:</strong> 23 Dec 2024</p> --> 
    <p>Peenya Metro Station at night was a world unto itself. The bustle of the day melted away into a ghostly calm, with only the occasional whistle of a distant train or the faint hum of an auto rickshaw breaking the silence. Murthy, an auto driver, had spent years navigating these streets, ferrying late-night passengers who were either too drunk, too tired, or too desperate to haggle over fares. But lately, his routine had been disrupted by <em>her</em>.</p>

    <p>She first appeared a month ago. Murthy had been idling near the station, waiting for his next passenger, when he noticed her. A woman in a black saree, her figure illuminated by the dim glow of the streetlight, stood by the side of the road. She seemed to be waiting, though for whom or what, Murthy couldn’t say. She had an aura about her - not one of beauty or allure, but something unsettling. Her eyes, sharp and piercing, scanned the line of autos. When they locked with Murthy’s, it was as if she’d reached into his chest and squeezed his heart. She quickly looked away, but the damage was done. Murthy’s hands trembled as he gripped the handlebars of his auto.</p>

    <p>She didn’t choose him that night. She flagged down another auto and disappeared into the night. But her presence lingered in his mind like a haunting melody.</p>

    <p>Night after night, she returned. Always in the same black saree, always at the same time - 1 a.m. Her routine never wavered. She’d stand for a few minutes, scanning the autos, before selecting one at random. Murthy began to feel as though she were performing some strange ritual. Each time their eyes met, he’d feel a chill run down his spine, and his curiosity grew stronger than his fear.</p>

    <p>He began to talk about her with the other drivers. “Have you noticed that woman in the black saree?” he’d ask, his voice low as though afraid she might hear. But the responses were bewildering.</p>

    <p>“What woman?” one driver replied, scratching his head.</p>

    <p>“Oh, her?” another said. “She’s harmless. Took my auto once, wearing a pink salwar kameez. Looked like a teacher or something.”</p>

    <p>“No, no,” Murthy insisted. “She’s always in a black saree.”</p>

    <p>The other drivers laughed it off, calling him paranoid. But Murthy’s obsession deepened. Each night, he found himself drawn to her, his mind racing with questions he couldn’t answer. Why did she wear the same saree? Why did she travel alone at such an ungodly hour? And why did no one else seem to notice her peculiarities?</p>

    <p>One particularly quiet night, Murthy decided he’d had enough of the guessing. When she appeared at her usual spot, he stayed back, watching as she flagged down another auto. <em>“Tonight, I’ll follow her,”</em> he whispered to himself.</p>

    <p>The auto she entered rumbled away, and Murthy trailed it at a safe distance. The streets grew darker and quieter as they moved away from the station. After about three kilometers, the auto suddenly screeched to a halt. Murthy pulled over, hiding his vehicle in the shadows.</p>

    <p>He watched as the other driver stumbled out of his auto, his face pale and twisted with fear. The woman in the black saree stepped out gracefully, as though she had all the time in the world. She walked toward the trembling man, holding something in her hand. Murthy squinted, trying to make it out. A small glass bottle. She placed it on the ground in front of the man.</p>

    <p>“Pick it up,” she said, her voice calm but commanding. The man shook his head, tears streaming down his face.</p>

    <p>“Please,” he begged. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”</p>

    <p>Murthy’s heart pounded in his chest. He wanted to intervene but found himself frozen in place, unable to move or even blink.</p>

    <p>“Pick it up,” she repeated, her tone unwavering. The man, sobbing uncontrollably, reached for the bottle. His hands shook as he unscrewed the cap. A sharp, acrid smell wafted through the air. Acid.</p>

    <p>The man screamed, his cries piercing the silence of the night. He poured the liquid onto his face, the flesh sizzling and melting away. Murthy watched in horror as the man collapsed to the ground, writhing in agony.</p>

    <p>The woman turned to look directly at Murthy. For the first time, he saw her face clearly, illuminated by the dim glow of a distant streetlight. It was grotesque, her features disfigured and scarred beyond recognition. Yet, her eyes were the same - sharp, piercing, and filled with a quiet intensity.</p>

    <p>Memories flooded Murthy’s mind. Five years ago, he had found a woman at this very spot, her face unrecognizable, her body writhing in pain. She had been the victim of an acid attack, left to die by the roadside. Murthy had taken her to the hospital, staying by her side for three days. He had done everything he could, but it hadn’t been enough. She had succumbed to her injuries, her identity lost to the world.</p>

    <p>Now, standing before him, was that same woman. Or her ghost. He couldn’t say which.</p>

    <p>Tears streamed down his face as he stepped out of his auto and approached her. “It’s you,” he whispered. “You’re… you’re the one I tried to save.”</p>

    <p>She didn’t speak. Instead, she smiled. A haunting, bittersweet smile that seemed to hold both gratitude and sorrow. And then, as quickly as she had appeared, she was gone.</p>

    <p>Murthy stood there, the night air heavy with the scent of acid and the echoes of the man’s screams. He didn’t know whether to feel relieved or burdened by her final act of vengeance. But one thing was certain: he would never forget the woman in black. </p>
